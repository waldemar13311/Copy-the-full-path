## Description
It is a simple PowerShell script that can help you copy full paths of files or folders from Windows' explorer context menu.

## How it work?
You have a file or folder and you need to copy the full path of it. You just make a right-mouse click, select the needed type of slash(in Windows style or in Linux style or style for WSL) and use it in your terminal or another program.

I don't know why Microsoft didn't make this useful function in the Explorer ðŸ¤”.
