## Description <a name="description"></a>
It is a simple PowerShell script that can help you copy full paths of files or folders from Windows' explorer context menu.

## How it work? <a name="howitwork"></a>
You have a file or folder and you need to copy the full path of it. You just make a right-mouse click, select the needed type of slash(in Windows style or in Linux style or style for WSL) and use it in your terminal or another program.

I don't know why Microsoft didn't make this useful function in the Explorer ðŸ¤”.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\user\Downloads> cd .\Copy-the-full-path\
```
4. Run install.ps1
```powershell
PS C:\Users\user\Downloads\Copy-the-full-path> .\install.ps1
```
5. Enter a path where you want to have a Copy-the-full-path. In this case, for example, installation will take place in `C:\Program Files`.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\user\Downloads\Copy-the-full-path> .\install.ps1
